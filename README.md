# odin_recipes
This project is called odin-recipes. It's my first project that I will manage to make after finishing HTML course in The Odin Project curriculum.
During this project, I will build a website that will consist of a main index page which will have  links to a few recipes, using images, links, paragraphs and lists.
(The project took around 2 hours)
